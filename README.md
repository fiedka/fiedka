# Fiedka

This is a work-in-progress version of [Fiedka](https://fiedka.app), based on the
[utk-web](https://github.com/fiedka/fiedka/tree/utk-web) prototype with a
back-end running in [WebAssembly](#webassembly) and written in Go.

[![Release](

## Development

The app is based on Electron.

You need to have a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) runtime and `npm` installed.
For the back-end, you need [Go](https://go.dev/) version 1.17 at least.
Find them in your respective OS distribution and install them through your
package manager, e.g., `yay -S go nodejs npm`.
On NixOS you can get a shell with all dependencies by running `nix-shell`.

To install the dependencies, run `npm install`.

For DXE GUIDs, efiXplorer is used as a submodule. Do an initial checkout:

```
git submodule update --init --checkout
```

### Adding Go dependencies

```sh
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go get github.com/...
```

```
